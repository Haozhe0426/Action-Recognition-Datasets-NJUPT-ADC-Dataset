The dataset contains 4 different movement categories, which are left akimbo, right akimbo, squat, stretch. Each action sample contains RGB video and skeleton data, the RGB video is captured by a fixed camera placed on the front, and the skeleton data is extracted by OpenPose
A total of 871 action samples were performed by 11 subjects of different body types
0：left akimbo, 1：right akimbo, 2：squat, 3：stretch
We suggest the actions performed by 7 subjects constitute the training set, and the actions performed by the other 4 subjects are used for testing.
